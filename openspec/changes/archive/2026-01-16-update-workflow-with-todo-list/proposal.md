# Change: Update workflow with mandatory todo list management

## Why
To improve transparency and ensure systematic execution of tasks, AI assistants must maintain a structured todo list for every non-trivial task. This helps the user track progress and ensures no steps are missed.

## What Changes
- Update `openspec/AGENTS.md` to include a mandatory "Todo List Management" section.
- Require the use of the `todowrite` tool (or equivalent structured markdown) at the start of every task.
- Require real-time updates to the todo list as tasks progress.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `workflow` (new capability)
- Affected documentation: `openspec/AGENTS.md`
